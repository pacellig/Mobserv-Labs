- explain how the application starts and interact with the files in www?

- how to create release version
command build --release

- raw, xml, json

for the raw format, datas are simply passed as a string, so in order to be accessed the string needs to be sliced and then we need to know the position of th einformation we need within the string

for xml datas are packed within tags, so we need to know the tag name to access specific data

for json we have a set of key/value pairs, and we can access to the information desired by providing the related key

- rest and soap

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol that allows programs that run on disparate operating systems (such as Windows and Linux) to communicate using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its Extensible Markup Language (XML)
SOAP relies exclusively on XML to provide messaging services

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications
Instead of using XML to make a request, REST relies on a simple URL in many cases
REST is protocol independent. It's not coupled to HTTP. Pretty much like you can follow an ftp link on a website, a REST application can use any protocol for which there is an standardized URI scheme.
